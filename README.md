# GameOrTask
A quick little script that randomly gives a task to do instead of starting a game.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python

This script monitors when a specific game is opened, and randomly interrupts by showing a task that needs to be completed before continuing or playing at all. It's a lightweight script written entirely in Python, using basic libraries for file handling and randomization.

## Optimizations
In the future, I'd like to add a simple interface that allows users to customize tasks without directly modifying the JSON file.

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me understand how to interact with system processes and how to package a Python script as an executable.
